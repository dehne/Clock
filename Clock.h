 *   The Clock class represents one of those Lavet motor quartz clock movements that are powered by a single
 *   AAA cell. It assumes the movement has been modified to bypass the quartz timing mechanism by tying
 *   the connections to the ends of its coil to two pins, tickPin and tockPin, of the Arduino. The clock is
 *   advanced by alternating pulses on the two pins. Each pulse advances the clock mechanism by one second.
